I've reviewed the WhatsAppTrayManager project specifications and implementation plan. I understand that this is a Windows utility application written in C# (.NET 6+) that enhances the WhatsApp Desktop experience with tray icon management, minimize-to-tray functionality, unread message monitoring, and auto-start configuration.

I'm ready to start implementing the project following the development checklist provided in todo.md, beginning with setting up the .NET 6 WinForms project structure and progressing through the component implementation as outlined in the development plan.
